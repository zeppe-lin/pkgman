## About

*prt* is a package management tool which provides additional
functionality to crux' package management system.

It appeared in an attempt to rewrite the
[prt-get](https://crux.nu/gitweb/?p=tools/prt-get.git;a=summary) tool
which is used by CRUX Linux distribution.

The main differences from *prt-get*:

- most of the *prt* code has been ported to -std=c++17;
- switch to cmake;
- `prt-cache`, `aliases`, `deplist` functionality was removed;
- added support of pre-/post-remove scripts;
- added `sync` command (`ports -u` replacement);
- added `depmiss` command to check for missing dependencies;
- the code was simplified; (!)

## Description

*prt* offers the following features:

- sync ports collections via various transports such as
git(1)/rsync(8)/httpup(8);

- abstract ports installation/update from file system;

- install/update a list of ports with one command;

- list dependencies for a list of ports and search a missing
dependencies of installed ports;

- show information about ports;

- search within the ports;

What *prt* basically does is installing and upgrading ports, using
pkgmk(8) and pkgadd(8). Additionally, you don't have be in the 
port's directory to call prt. It will search for the respective
port itself in a list of directories specified in */etc/prt.conf*.
This allows you to just install or update a port, without caring
where it actually is located on your file system.

*prt also offers some features like searching ports by name/description,
showing information about ports (without installing them of course), and
provide a complete dependency list for a port.

See man page for more details.
