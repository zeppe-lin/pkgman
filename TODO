	[X] issue: pkgman --config-append="runscripts no" doesn't
	    working?
	    Done: Fri Aug 18 07:27:40 PM EEST 2023
	    Fixed by 4251b0ba4e77804fc2aaca24d251f753cf162d45.

	[ ] issue: if package is already built with .footprint
	    mismatch, pkgman will install it

	[ ] issue: investigate the following behaviour:

		pkgman sysup --depsort --deps --group
		pkgman: preparing libcap-ng 0.8.3-1
		pkgman: md5sum verification failed.

		-- Packages where build failed
		libcap-ng

		pkgman: preparing alsa-lib 1.2.7.1-1
		^Cpkgman: interrupted

	[ ] issue: investigate the following behaviour:

		pkgrm: could not remove /usr/share/icons/Mint-X-Teal/:
		Directory not empty
		pkgrm: package libsass not installed
		pkgrm: could not remove /usr/share/icons/Raleigh/:
		Directory not empty

		-- Packages where removal failed
		libsass

		-- Packages removed
		sassc
		libsass
		mint-x-icons
		mint-y-icons
		mint-themes
		gtk-theme-raleigh

	[ ] idea: ansi colors?
	The consensus is that the ASCII is better? Just format the code like
	following:

		=======> This is an example of simple informational message.
		=======> WARNING: This is an example of warning message.
		=======> ERROR: This is an example of error message.

	[ ] idea: add "ignore" directive to pkgman.conf?
