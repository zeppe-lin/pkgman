	[ ] issue: if package is already built with .footprint
	    mismatch, pkgman will install it

	[ ] issue: investigate the following behaviour:

		pkgman sysup --depsort --deps --group
		pkgman: preparing libcap-ng 0.8.3-1
		pkgman: md5sum verification failed.

		-- Packages where build failed
		libcap-ng

		pkgman: preparing alsa-lib 1.2.7.1-1
		^Cpkgman: interrupted

	[ ] issue: investigate the following behaviour:

		pkgrm: could not remove /usr/share/icons/Mint-X-Teal/:
		Directory not empty
		pkgrm: package libsass not installed
		pkgrm: could not remove /usr/share/icons/Raleigh/:
		Directory not empty

		-- Packages where removal failed
		libsass

		-- Packages removed
		sassc
		libsass
		mint-x-icons
		mint-y-icons
