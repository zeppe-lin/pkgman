PKGMAN-README(7)

# NAME

pkgman-readme - optional README files for packages

# SYNOPSIS

README.md and README files provide additional information about
packages and are accessed using *pkgman-readme*(1).

# DESCRIPTION

README.md or README files in a package's source directory offer
supplementary details that go beyond the core functionality of
pre/post-install and pre/post-remove scripts.

If both README.md and README files exist, README.md takes precedence.
These files are optional.

## Typical Contents

A README file may include the following sections:

*POST-INSTALL*, *PRE-INSTALL*, *POST-REMOVE*, *PRE-REMOVE*:
	Manual instructions for users who have disabled the execution
	of scripts.

*REQUIREMENTS*:
	Information about additional (optional) packages that enhance
	the software functionality.

*KERNEL CONFIGURATION*:
	Details for users compiling custom kernels, specifying
	required kernel configurations.

*KERNEL MODULE*:
	Which kernel modules need to be loaded at startup for proper
	program operation.  Include steps for enabling them if needed.

*UPGRADE*:
	Recommendations for handling upgrades, especially between
	major versions.  Highlight potential pitfalls, required steps,
	and troubleshooting for common errors.

*CAUTION*, *TROUBLESHOOTING*:
	Warnings about issues users may encounter, along with
	solutions to address them.

*REFERENCES*:
	Links to detailed online documentation, wikis, or related
	resources.

## Guidelines

When creating README files, maintainers should:

	\* Povide clear and concise instructions.

	\* Structure content with sections for key topics described
	above.

	\* Avoid redundancy by excluding information covered in other
	scripts or documentation.

These guidelines primarily apply to official repositories.  Custom
repositories may adapt README content to suit their needs.
