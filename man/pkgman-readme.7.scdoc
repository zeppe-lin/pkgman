PKGMAN-README(7)

# NAME

pkgman-readme - README file conventions for packages

# SYNOPSIS

README or README.md in package source directory

# DESCRIPTION

A package README provides extra information for users, such as
post-install steps, configuration notes, or usage tips.

Choose one format: plain text (README) or Markdown (README.md).
Do not include both.
If both are present, *pkgman-readme*(1) displays README.md and ignores
README.

Notifications about README files are controlled by the *readme*
directive in *pkgman.conf*(5).

# FILE FORMAT

README files may be plain text or Markdown.
Keep them concise, relevant, and easy to scan.

Common sections include:

*REQUIREMENTS*
	Conditions needed for correct operation, or optional
	packages that enhances functionality.

	*Kernel Configuration*
		Required kernel settings for custom kernels.

	*Kernel Module*
		Modules to load at startup and how to enable them.

	*Optional Packages*
		Extra libraries or tools that extend functionality
		beyond the declared build/runtime dependencies.

*CONFIGURATION*
	Minimal setup instructions after install.
	Point to config file paths, directories, or service scripts.
	Include one or two short examples.

*NOTES*
	General caveats, quirks, or hardware-specific advice.
	Keep concise and actionable.

*TROUBLESHOOTING*
	Known issues, cautions, and resolutions.

*INSTALL/REMOVE*
	Manual steps for users who disable *pkgman-runscripts*(7):
	*pre-install*,
	*post-install*,
	*pre-remove*,
	*post-remove*.

*UPGRADE*
	Major version upgrade steps, pitfalls, and fixes.

*FURTHER READING*
	Documentation, wikis, or related resources.

Include only sections that are relevant.
Official repositories follow these conventions; custom repositories
may adapt as needed.

# FILES
