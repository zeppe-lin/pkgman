PKGMAN-README(7)

# NAME

pkgman-readme - README file conventions for packages

# SYNOPSIS

README or README.md in package source directory

# DESCRIPTION

A package README provides extra information for users, such as
post-install steps, configuration notes, or usage tips.

Choose one format: plain text (README) or Markdown (README.md).
Do not include both.
If both are present, *pkgman-readme*(1) displays README.md and ignores
README.

Notifications about README files are controlled by the *readme*
directive in *pkgman.conf*(5).

# FILE FORMAT

README files may be plain text or Markdown.
Keep them concise, relevant, and easy to scan.

Common sections include:

*POST-INSTALL*, *PRE-INSTALL*, *POST-REMOVE*, *PRE-REMOVE*
	Manual steps for users who disable *pkgman-runscripts*(7)
	execution.

*REQUIREMENTS*
	Optional packages that enhance functionality.

*KERNEL CONFIGURATION*
	Required kernel settings for custom kernels.

*KERNEL MODULE*
	Modules to load at startup and how to enable them.

*UPGRADE*
	Major version upgrade steps, pitfalls, and fixes.

*CAUTION*, *TROUBLESHOOTING*
	Known issues and resolutions.

*REFERENCES*
	Documentation, wikis, or related resources.

Include only sections that are relevant.
Official repositories follow these conventions; custom repositories
may adapt as needed.
