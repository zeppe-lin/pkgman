PKGMAN-README(7)

# NAME

pkgman-readme - README file conventions for packages

# SYNOPSIS

README or README.md in package source directory

# DESCRIPTION

A package's README file provides extra information for the user, such
as post-installation steps, configuration notes, or usage tips.

Choose one format - plain text (README) or Markdown (README.md) - for
package source; there is no need to include both.
If both files are present, *pkgman-readme*(1) displays README.md and
ignores README.
Notifications about README files are controlled by the *readme*
setting in *pkgman.conf*(5).

# FILE FORMAT

README files may be plain text or Markdown.
Keep them concise, relevant, and easy to scan.

## Contents

Use clear section headings for any topics that apply to the package,
and keep instructions short and direct.
Avoid repeating information already covered in scripts or other
documentation.
Common sections include:

*POST-INSTALL*, *PRE-INSTALL*, *POST-REMOVE*, *PRE-REMOVE*
	Give manual steps for users who have disabled script
	execution.

*REQUIREMENTS*
	List optional packages that enhance functionality.

*KERNEL CONFIGURATION*
	Specify required kernel settings for custom kernels.

*KERNEL MODULE*
	Name modules to load at startup and how to enable them.

*UPGRADE*
	Note major version upgrade steps, pitfalls, and fixes.

*CAUTION*, *TROUBLESHOOTING*
	Warn about known issues and how to resolve them.

*REFERENCES*
	Link to documentation, wikis, or related resources.

Include only sections that are relevant.
Official repositories follow these conventions; custom repositories
may adapt as needed.
